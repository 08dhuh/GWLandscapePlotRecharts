# Interactive Graphs for GWLandscape

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of **interactive graph components** developed as a part of the **GWLandscape Project**. These components are designed to visualise astrophysical phenomena with a focus on **Binary Black Hole (BBH) mergers**. By migrating computationally heavy plotting methods to the front-end, the repository provides real-time, physics-accurate, and highly interactive visualisations.

## Key Features

### Visualisation of Binary Black Hole Mergers
- Migrated plotting methods from back-end to front-end modules for enhanced performance and responsiveness.  
- Enabled real-time interactive displays of astrophysical events, including:
  - **Mass transfer events**.  
  - **Stellar evolution stages** (e.g., core collapse and mass loss).  
- Interactive plots that dynamically and accurately represent BBH merger physics.

### Scalable React Component Architecture
- Designed and structured React components for scalability and maintainability.  
- Developed a modular architecture that supports:  
  - Future extensions for astrophysical models.  
  - Seamless integration with the **GWLandscape Project's main code base**.  
  - Enhanced user experience through responsive and intuitive interfaces.

## Components in the Repository

This repository provides a diverse set of React components, including:  

1. **Line Chart Visualisers**  
   - Depict properties such as **mass transfer rates** and **orbital separations**.  

2. **HR Diagram Renderer**  
   - Visualises stellar properties like **luminosity** and **effective temperature**.  

3. **Van Den Heuvel Model Viewer**  
   - A unique tool for exploring specific BBH formation scenarios.  

## Use Cases

The interactive graph repository is an essential tool for:  
- **Astrophysicists** studying BBH formation channels.  
- **Researchers** visualising stellar evolution and binary merger stages.  
- **Educators** demonstrating astrophysical phenomena with intuitive and interactive displays.  

## Development Notes

This repository follows modern React development best practices, including:  
- **State management** with the Context API and custom hooks.  
- **Responsive designs** powered by Recharts and CSS modules.  
- A **scalable component architecture** designed for future enhancements.
